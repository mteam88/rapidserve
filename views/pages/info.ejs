        Cedric Hotopp and Matthew Edelen are the creators of this website. 
        They created the website with Gitpod.io, Github.com, and NodeJS.
        Most of the client-side content that you see was created by Matthew,
        while most of the (more difficult) server-side programming was done by Cedric.
        Thanks to
        <ul> 
        <li>Mr. Rattay and his support</li>
        <li>Mrs. Bernard for giving us time to work on the website in class</li>
        <li>The whole of the programming community for indirect help on a variety of issues.</li>
        </ul>
